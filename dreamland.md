**Dreamland** is a metaverse company and has a concept of games, where every user can play these games and win **DREAM** tokens multiple times a day. A user can win upto _5_ **DREAM** tokens on a single day.

**DREAM** tokens are a virtual currency and have a real monetary value. At the end of every hour, the tokens won by the user are converted to **USD** by calling a third-party API that provides the rate (for the assignment, we can hardcode to 15 cents per token).

Every time a user is issued a token and it gets converted to USD, there will be fees which we need to keep track of (the user will not bear the fees, but **Dreamland** will)

In the backend, there are **double-entry accounting ledgers** that keep track of a user's tokens, the current USD value and the fees.

Imagine you are building APIs for Dreamland:

1. API that accepts that a user has won some amount of **DREAM** token at a particular time of a day (can be fractional tokens)
2. API that returns the history of **DREAM** tokens a user has won for the current day so far
3. API that returns the history of **USD** amounts a user has won till now (till the previous day)
4. API that returns the stats: sum of tokens won on the current day so far and the total value of **USD** a user has in his account

Let's focus on the below for the design side of things:

1. Database table design given the APIs above
2. Database needs to have a solid double-entry ledger to track the tokens and USD (might make sense to read up about ledgers - some great sources [here](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/books-an-immutable-double-entry-accounting-database-service/) and [here](https://fragmentdev.notion.site/Fragment-Guide-da9c2d99195547c3a9ccf05f2ddd52cf)). Let's design ledgers for both the tokens and USD
3. Data types we can use for the ledger amounts (it needs to support the smallest and largest unit of a crypto token)
4. Edge cases - list some edge cases both in APIs and database that you will handle
5. Any other APIs and tools you can think of (no need to implement)
6. Infrastructure - This is a global system with customers across the world. Let's discuss more about setting up the infra, how to share data across different regions, how to solve for region-specific data for issues like GDPR, how to replicate some tables out of a region to a central cluster for analytics, etc. This is just a textual answer with maybe some design diagrams
